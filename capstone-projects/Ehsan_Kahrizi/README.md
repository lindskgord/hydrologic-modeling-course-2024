# Assessing the Potential of Integrating Hydrological Modelling Outputs with Logan River Observatory Gauge Datasets to Improve Anomaly Detection of Streamflow Data in the Franklin Sub-watershed

This repository contains data and scripts necessary for reproducing the ATS model.

## Summary
Hydrological models typically contain multiple inputs, and their power relies on accessing reliable input datasets. One of the inputs is field data collected by the in-situ sensors (Reitan, T. 2022; Horsburgh et al., 2015; Gibert et al., 2018).
The field data collected by in-situ sensors contains different hydrological patterns, e.g., natural flow variations, flood events, gaining or losing state, or drought, that could complicate the analysis of model outputs. Further, field infrastructure, which is used for measuring the in-situ data, has issues that sometimes create errors in the dataset, e.g., calibration errors and maintenance artifacts, sensor failure. This interaction adds many complexities to the models' input and makes the models' predictions unreliable. There is a demand to determine whether observed patterns in model outputs are due to genuine hydrological processes or are created by field measurement infrastructure. Currently, no study distinguishes patterns resulting from hydrological processes and anomalies caused by sensor issues (Shen, 2018; Jones et al., 2022).
My project is about integrating hydrological modeling with automated anomaly detection to know how hydrological models can assist in differentiating between sensor-related anomalies/errors and actual hydrological patterns/processes. By answering this question, I plan to develop a workflow that uses hydrological model predictions to validate sensor data anomalies and accurately classify them as either sensor errors or genuine hydrological events. My expected result is to present an analysis/workflow that helps better understand the hydrological process. 

## Methods
Modeling: I will use the ATS Model to simulate the streamflow dynamics of surface water. 
Data Collection and Preparation: I will use the LRO datasets at the Franklin site, which are available every 15 minutes. 
For the ATS simulation, I will retrieve the required inputs, like soil texture, precipitation, evapotranspiration, meshes, etc., from free-access platforms like USGS. Modeling Approach: I will try to simulate hydrological conditions during known periods of sensor anomalies (e.g., ice burial and out-of-water events) to check patterns from the model response with sensor data. I will identify patterns using a predefined threshold where sensor anomalies align with model predictions (indicating natural events) and where they do not (indicating sensor errors).
